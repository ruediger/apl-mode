* apl-mode - Emacs mode for APL.

*NOTE:* I don't have any plans of updating this mode in the foreseeable future.
Please take a look at [[https://github.com/lokedhs/gnu-apl-mode][GNU APL mode]] instead.

This is an Emacs mode for the APL programming language.  See [[http://www.gnu.org/software/apl/][GNU APL]] for a free
APL implementation.

It is in a very early stage of development and is buggy and missing functions.
See todo.org and contribute patches!

What is implemented so far:

- basic mode (apl-mode)
- some function help (needs improvement)
- eldoc support
- an input method based on the unicode character names (apl-input)
- an advanced input method allowing stuff like "<-" for ← etc. (apl-input-x)
- an inferior mode to run APL inside Emacs (inferior-apl)
